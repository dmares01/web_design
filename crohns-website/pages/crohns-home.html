            To put it simply, Crohn's is an autoimmune disease. Well that just leads to more questions. What is an autoimmune
            disease? What does that mean? Dont worry I will try my best to explain all of that in more, hopefully in aome
            way you can understand unlike most of the medical websites out there right now. A lot of these questions were
            the exact same ones I had when I was first diagnosed with crohn's disease.<br>

            <h3>Diarrhea</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: A condition in which feces are discharged from the bowels frequently and in a liquid form
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Diarrhea happens to everyone, unfortunately it is quite common in people with Crohn's disease.
                Your digestive tract can be pretty finicky at times and Diarrhea is especially common during a
                <a class="flare-up" href="#flare">flare up</a>. Many states will offer a bathroom card allowing you to
                use private restrooms or skip a line if you need too. I've had my card for nine years and have not had
                to use it yet, but it is still something I carry around with me just in case.

            <h3>Mouth Sores</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: A small ulcer of the mouth or lips.
            </p>
            <p>
                Mouth sores are one of those things were they are an inconvenience but do not hinder your day to day life
                unless unchecked. Most will go away on there own in about a week, although it will vary from person to
                person.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Unexplained Weight Loss</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: A sudden loss in weight not explainable by diet, exercise, or other means
            </p>

                When you have Crohn's disease and parts of your digestive tract are inflamed (common during a
                <a class="flare-up" href="#flare">flare up</a>), your ability to absorb vitamins and nutrients can be
                severely impacted. This inability to absorb nutrients can cause malnutrition, or simply prevent you from getting enough
                calories each day.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Fever</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: an abnormally high body temperature, usually accompanied by shivering, headache, and in severe instances, delirium
            </p>
            <p>
                What else is there to say? A fever is a fever and everyone is going to get them. Personally I feel that
                a fever could be a symptom for almost anything in the world. Although with the other complications that
                can be present in Crohn's disease, having a fever can become more common.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Abdominal Pain and Cramping</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: Abdominal pain can be acute or chronic. Can refer to pain that is perceived anywhere in the abdominal area.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'll be real, abdominal pain is one of those things that will be very common. There will be days that it's
                just annoying and can be ignored, and then there are those days you don't even want to get out of bed. No
                matter how mild or severe your Crohn's is, you will experience abdominal pain at some point.
            </p>

        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Fatigue</h3>

                Definition: extreme tiredness resulting from mental or physical exertion or illness
            </p>
            <p>
                This is another one that is quite common. When your body is having a
                <a class="flare-up" href="#flare">flare up</a> it's going to take a lot out of you. Your energy levels
                will not be the same as when you're in <a class="flare-up" href="#flare">remission.</a>

        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Reduced Appetite</h3>
            <p>
                Definition:  A reduced desire to eat. May also be known as a poor appetite or loss of appetite
            </p>
            <p>
                When your stomach hurts or is upset, you're just not gonna want to eat. Although food will oftentimes help,
                sometimes that's easier said than done. Bland soup and crackers will be your be your best friend.
            </p>

        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Rectal Bleeding</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: Refers to the passage of bright blood (often mixed with clots or stools) via the rectum
            </p>
            <p>
                This one is a big red flag (no pun intended). Any bleeding should be brought up to the doctor as soon as
                possible. This means that a decent amount of inflammation is going on inside your intestines and needs to get
                looked at. If left unchecked it can end up doing more damage to your system and worsen your Crohn's.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Blood in Stool</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: This refers to bleeding somewhere in your digestive tract. Sometimes the amount of blood is
                so small that it can only be detected by a fecal occult test
            </p>
            <p>
                Very similar and will often go hand in hand with the rectal bleeding. This occurs when you're bleeding but
                in smaller amounts. AS your stool passes through your system the blood will come out with it.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="symptom">
            <h3>Fistulas</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: an abnormal or surgically made passage between a hollow or tubular organ and the body
                surface, or between two hollow or tubular organs.
            </p>
            <p>
                These absolutely suck. They can be very painful, they're drainage tubes for pus so they aren't very pretty,
                and they can just be uncomfortable. Fistula's can close up and heal when your Crohn's is in

            <h3>Inflammation of Skin, Eyes, and Joints</h3>
            <p>
                Definition: Inflammation is the body's attempt at self-protection to remove harmful stimuli and
                begin the healing process
            </p>
            <p>
                For this, inflammation of the joints is the most common. Sore joints can be reoccurring, obviously it varies
                with the person. Having your eyes be bloodshot can also happen often depending on how well your Crohn's
                is controlled.

        <div class="symptom">

            </p>
            <p>
                I can't say I have any personal experience with this one but from talking with people in the community or
                doctors, it doesn't seem to be very prevalent. When it does occur it is most often detected by tests done
                by a doctor.

            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly I feel that this definition is redundant. It's true that kids diagnosed with Crohn's disease can
                have stunted growth. Oftentimes doctors will correct this right away, or do their best to ensure that the
                child is still able to continue their growth.

            A flare up is when your Crohn's disease is having problems. This is often signified by an increase in inflammation
            in the affected areas of the body, increase in fatigue and exhaustion, as well as worsening of the other symptoms.
            The increase in inflammation is often the biggest issue. Everyone's body uses inflammation to fight off bacteria
            or viruses. It is the part of the body's self defense mechanism. Having Crohn's disease your body will inflame areas
            larger than it should, and stay inflamed longer than it should. This can cause further damage to your intestines
            and end up making things worse.
        </p>
        <p>
            You and your doctor will try and keep your body out of a flare up as much as possible. It will take some
            experimenting to figure out what works best for you and what is needed, but it will get figured out. As you
            and your doctor figure out the best plan, than your body should start to enter remission.

        <h2>Remission: The Place to be</h2>

        </aside>
        <p>
            Remission is where you want to be. It means that your Crohn's is under control and in good shape. Once you
            have a plan that works, all it requires is sticking to it. You may need small tweaks here or there, but once
            your body is in remission it is much easier to stay there.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to explain it similar to a pendulum. When your body is in a flare up you are all the way at one end
            of the pendulum. In order to balance your body back out you must counter with stronger medicines, more exercise,
            and a bette diet. This will start to pull your body back towards the middle. As you start to get closer to the
            middle you can slowly loosen up your diet and exercise routines. The maintenance required to stay in remission
            is a lot less than the effort required to get there. As they say an object in motion stays in motion.
