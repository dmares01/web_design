# Slider #

The basis of this assignment was to get experience with using animation in CSS and how we could create a slider by using multiple images. This assignment also showed the importance of positioning, sizing of certain containers, and how overflow can be used. 

## Skills Learned from this Project ##

This project gave me good practice on using CSS animation as well as stringing the images together. The overflow aspect threw me off for quite a while until I realized I was trying to hide the overflow on the wrong container. Another thing I learned was that the container holding the images had to have a width big enough to accomadate them all, and that the width of the container could be wider than the container it was in. In essence a child could have a width wider than it's parent. Although that makes sense, at the time it was something I had never really thought about.
