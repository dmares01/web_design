# Yggdrasil: Nordic Tree of Life #

This project was the first project I did for the DMA class. It was initially made to work with relative
linking, and having multiple html pages instead of just a single page as I've done in the past. Having never
used relative linking or having a place on a server to store files, I never realized how useful it could be.
Having things split up into multiple pages vastly decreases load times, especially when the user may not need
all of the information anyways. In the past I would just use javascript to hide elements not being used until
the user clicked, indicating they wanted to view the information. While this then appears faster for the user
as it is already loaded. It has a great impact on that initial load time. 

## Ideas Moving Forward ##
- - - -
1. Finish the pages that are currently "Under Construction"
2. Add more information to pages instead of just using placeholders
3. Finish Blog posts, and add individual pages for those possibly
4. Refine stylesheet and add some more color to the pages

## Class Requirements ##

As we progress in class I will continue to add to this project and will have to make other projects
as well. Please check back in to see how the project progresses
