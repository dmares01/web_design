            <h1>Yggdrasil: Nordic Tree of Life</h1>
            <p>
                This project was a starter project for the first few assignments in the course and contains information
                about the nordic tree of life, Yggdrasil. <br> This project is still under development and will hopefully
                in the near future be a nice summary of the Yggdrasil and the importance of it in Norse Mythology.
