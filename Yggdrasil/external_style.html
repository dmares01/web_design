        I love taking class at augsburg. I get spoiled in the fact that computer science is housed in their newest
        and shiniest building, but it's all good. Every professor I've had over there has been very knowledgeable
        about their classes, and is always more than willing to help out when it is needed. The entire computer science
        department there is great. I have yet to have a bad encounter with a professor, or take a class that did not
        interest me<br>
        The other page is about my time in my public speaking class at Hamline. Click
        <a href="external_style_2.html">here</a> to check it out.

        Here is an example footer that would contain links and information about the page. For now it just contains a link
        to the other page for the assignment <a href="external_style_2.html">here</a>.
