        Some content to be styled on the page. Did you know that my public speaking class got done 45 minutes early today?
        I'm kind of shocked but I'm not gonna argue. This class has so far been super easy and we've only listened
        to people give speeches and have to give an extemp speech.
        The other page is about my time at Augsburg. <br>
        Click <a href="external_style.html">here</a> to check it out.

    <footer>
        Here is an example footer that would contain links and information about the page. For now it just contains a link
        to the other page for the assignment <a href="external_style.html">here</a>.
