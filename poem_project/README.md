# Poem Project #

This project is to work with linking multiple pages together. From there we will add a different background image to each in order to expand on the ideas talked about in the poem, and work on design elements to have each page maintain a similar theme. 

## Hummingbird ##

The poem I chose to do is "Hummingbird" by Robin Becker. Poems about nature have always been interesting and I chose this poem before truly actually reading it deeply. I just kind of skimmed through and decided, eh this will work for th project. Now actually going through the poem, I realized how different it is then is shown from just a quick glance through.

## Skills Learned from this Project ##

This project gave me good practice on linking together multiple pages, which is something I am becoming much more comfortable with, and a lot of good design practices. The art approach to web design is something I have been missing for a while, so this class is making up for it. I feel that this project is much more visually appealing than the last.
