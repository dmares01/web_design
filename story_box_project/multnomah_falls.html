                    The road trip had started. We were leaving the midwest and were traveling as far west as the land
                    would take us. What else would a group of college students do? We wanted to travel, but plane tickets
                    weren't an option. We all piled into a minivan with a week's worth of clothes, some tents, and as much
                    food as we could scavenge. The journey began.

                    One of our first stops along the way was Multnomah Falls. It was very touristy, but turned into a
                    beautiful little stop with a cafe, gift shop, and cafe. The trails were easy to walk along and were
                    pretty well maintained. With how steep it was, I'm glad we had the switchbacks.
