# Web Design: DMA 1460
This repository contains classwork for the DMA 1460 class at Hamline University. My goals for this course are just to refine my design skills. I've worked with HTML, CSS, and JS in the past, but I have never taken any design course. Of course having all of the information on the webpage in an organized way is important, but it must also be layed out attractively to engage viewers. 

Feel free to check out my webpage at dma.hamline.edu/~dmares01. Any updates I make should be posted to the server within 48 hours. Please feel free to email me with critiques or ideas at dmares01@hamline.edu. The whole point of this class is to learn and refine my skills so I will gladly take any and all feedback.
